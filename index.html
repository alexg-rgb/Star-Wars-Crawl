       <p>In fact just one week and a half ago I have started my journey at becode.</p>
       <p>And this journey is quiet intresting.</p>
       <p>We had a lot of informations in a short time which was kind of difficult at the begining.</p>
       <p>I discover a complete new way of learning and I like it.</p>
       <p>The only bad thing at the moment is the remote system. I would prefer to be on site.</p>
       <p>Anyway, all the things we learn are pretty cool.</p>
